# fillit
A program that takes Tetriminos as input and finds the smallest square with these Tetriminos.
A Tetrimino is for example : `##..
                              .#..
                              .#..
                              ....`

# What I learned
This project taught me how to use recursion to backtrack and solve problems in a more effcient way. This project helped me get a full grasp of recursion and most importantly how to use it.

# How to use
- clone the repository
- use make to compile
- make clean to clear objectfiles
- make fclean to remove binary
- run with ./fillit <input_file>
